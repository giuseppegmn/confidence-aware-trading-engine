CATE — Signed Confidence Attestation Model (v1)

ARCHITECTURE
- Risk evaluation is performed OFF-CHAIN by a deterministic engine
- On-chain program verifies authenticity, freshness, and replay safety
- Decisions are accepted only if signed by a trusted authority

ON-CHAIN RESPONSIBILITIES
- Verify Ed25519 signatures via syscall
- Enforce timestamp freshness
- Prevent replay attacks via decision hash registry
- Persist last known risk state per asset

OFF-CHAIN RESPONSIBILITIES
- Ingest oracle data (price, confidence, publishers)
- Compute confidence-aware risk score
- Produce signed decision hash

SECURITY MODEL
- Single trusted signer (rotatable by authority)
- Instruction-sysvar-based Ed25519 verification
- Time-bounded validity window

THIS PROGRAM DOES NOT:
- Fetch oracle data
- Compute confidence metrics
- Execute trades
