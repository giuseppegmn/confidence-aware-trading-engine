CATE — Decision Hash Specification (v1)

PURPOSE
The decision_hash uniquely represents a signed risk decision.
Any change to inputs MUST change the hash.

ENCODING
- All numeric values are little-endian
- Strings are UTF-8, fixed-length or padded
- Hash algorithm: SHA-256

FIELDS (IN ORDER)

1. asset_id
   - type: bytes[16]
   - UTF-8 string, right-padded with zeros

2. risk_score
   - type: u8
   - range: 0–100

3. is_blocked
   - type: u8
   - 0 = allow, 1 = block

4. confidence_ratio
   - type: u64
   - basis points (1% = 100)

5. publisher_count
   - type: u8

6. timestamp
   - type: i64
   - unix timestamp (seconds)

7. program_id
   - type: bytes[32]
   - Solana program id anchoring this decision

SERIALIZATION
The fields are concatenated in the exact order above with no separators.

HASH
decision_hash = SHA256(serialized_bytes)

SECURITY NOTES
- program_id binding prevents cross-program replay
- timestamp enforces freshness window
- asset_id padding is deterministic
